# SearchApp

### Added features:
#### A page where we can see all products. 
#### A component whose product detail can be accessed when clicked using functions such as filter(), map().

### Will be added later:
#### Using useLocation and useNavigate, to provide access to the product we are looking for with the keyword we type in the search button.
